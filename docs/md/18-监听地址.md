# 关于localhost、0.0.0.0、127.0.0.1地址说明

see [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20778771/what-is-the-difference-between-0-0-0-0-127-0-0-1-and-localhost)

## 127.0.0.1

127.0.0.1 is normally the IP address assigned to the "loopback" or local-only interface. This is a "fake" network adapter that can only communicate within the same host. It's often used when you want a network-capable application to only serve clients on the same host. A process that is listening on 127.0.0.1 for connections will only receive local connections on that socket.

## localhost

"localhost" is normally the hostname for the 127.0.0.1 IP address. It's usually set in /etc/hosts (or the Windows equivalent named "hosts" somewhere under %WINDIR%). You can use it just like any other hostname - try "ping localhost" to see how it resolves to 127.0.0.1.

## 0.0.0.0

when a server is told to listen on 0.0.0.0 that means "listen on every available network interface".
